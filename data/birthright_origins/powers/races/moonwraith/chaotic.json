    "description": "Luminates are hard to gauge, as both types of them are extremely different. Sunbeings are created, and live only to help and guide others. They are incapable of evil, and so, a moral question often comes up when discussing their kind - are they truly morally good, or do they simply act good for they have no other option? Nightborn are the opposite, being born to snuff out adventurers and cut the tales of life short, and are incapable of good.",
