    "description": "Venuvians, whilst it differs slightly from grove to grove, exclusively live to protect and serve their homeland. Incredibly nationalistic through and through, there isn't a single atom of a Venuvian which would betray it's homeland over willing itself into non-existence. They can skip the first stage of forming a civilisation, and instead immediately start as a small town. However, they cannot ever leave their jungles, and politics nation to nation are strained.",
