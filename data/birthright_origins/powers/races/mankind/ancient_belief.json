    "description": "Humans generally believe that their birthright is the world itself. Born first, mankind has existed for far longer than all the newer races, and in such, it is hard to disagree. Entire generations of humans have devoted themselves to this holy belief,  and whilst it doesn't offer any benefit for human to non-human relations, all human to human politics can generally reach higher conclusions or agreements - assuming they too share this ancient belief. This manifests as an political ability to set extra or more elaborate conditions in group or kingdom discussion.",
