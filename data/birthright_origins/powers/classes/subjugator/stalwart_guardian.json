    "description": "If many beasts came to bite at the same time, you must be prepared. Your armour is your life - without it, you are defenceless, and by extension, so too is civilisation itself. Because you serve all things Orderly, your armour counts as 50% more, but you cannot harm your fellow brothers and sisters - however, Chaotic characters take 50% more damage from your attacks.",
