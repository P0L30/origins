    "name": "Vilified",
    "description": "For good reason, you are extremely vilified across the lands for your abuse of the natural cycle of arcane magic. You are outlawed from all Orderly civilisations, and Subjugators are given express orders to kill you. Magic in this form is too powerful, too concentrated, and shouldn't be used by people - at least, that's what they argue. Their squeals won't bother you as you cook them alive with fireballs.",
