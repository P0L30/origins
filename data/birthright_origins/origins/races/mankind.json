    "description": "Often said to be the eldest race still thriving, humanity has a thumb in every proverbial pie. Their reach is wide, their influence powerful, and their conquering skill unrefutable. Their greatest boon by far, however, is their minds - it is extremely rare for a human to settle, rather, they will invent solutions and philosophise a problem or task until it is fully and utterly reduced to it's simplest form. In fact, this psychology is proven by one of their first inventions - fire itself.",
