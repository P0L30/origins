    "description": "Order is not an easy thing to maintain. It requires level-headedness, critical thinking, emotional maturity, and, last but not least, a will of steel. To punish those who step out of line, and ensure others who would step, to do no such thing.\n\nYou have taken the first step towards maintaining perfect Order, starting your trials as a Subjugator. Only time can tell if you shall pass or fail, but, should you pass, you are able to take the Oath - which would turn you into the ultimate defender, a Paragon of Order.",
